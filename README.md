# LLMCompiler

&emsp;LLMCompiler is an Agent Architecture designed to speed up the execution of agent tasks by executing them quickly
in the DAG. It also saves the cost of redundant token use by reducing the number of calls to the LLM. The realization
inspiration comes from An LLM Compiler for Parallel Function Calling.
